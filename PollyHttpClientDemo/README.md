# PollyHttpClientDemo (.NET 8, Dockerized)

This project demonstrates how to use **Polly** in an ASP.NET Core 8 Web API to make resilient HTTP requests. It includes examples of:

- **Retry Policy** â€“ for handling transient faults
- **Circuit Breaker Policy** â€“ to avoid repeated calls to unstable services
- **HttpClientFactory** â€“ integrating Polly policies with named clients
- **Docker support** â€“ for running the app and mock API service locally

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

This project simulates a real-world scenario where:

- Your API consumes another external service
- That external service may become **temporarily unavailable**
- You want to **retry** failed calls a few times
- If the service is unstable, you want to **break the circuit** temporarily

All this is handled cleanly using Polly policies and modern .NET 8 best practices.
